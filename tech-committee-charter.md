# Technical Committee Charter
## Guiding Principle

The OpenFeature project will operate transparently, collaboratively, ethically, and in alignment with the interests of OpenFeature technology end-users. Project proposals, timelines, and status must not merely be open, but also easily visible to and discoverable by outsiders.

## Evolution of OpenFeature Governance

Most large, complex open source communities have both a business and a technical governance model. OpenFeature has a project-level Governance Committee, a project-level Technical Committee, and is a Sandbox project in the Cloud Native Computing Foundation.

This OpenFeature Technical Committee Charter reflects the scope and expectations of the Technical Committee ("TC") with the maintainers, the consumers, and the ecosystem of the project. The charter will not be perfect, and so has a simple amendment process â€“ a TC member proposes changes to be discussed and voted on by the full TC.

## Establishment of the Technical Committee

TC memberships are not time-limited. There is no maximum size of the TC. The size is expected to vary in order to ensure adequate coverage of important areas of expertise, balanced with the ability to make decisions efficiently. The TC must have at least four members and is recommended to have an odd number of members for tie-breaking purposes.

TC membership is developed through leadership in the project and was bootstrapped initially by selection of most prolific contributors in the early stages of the project. The TC may add additional members to the TC by the [election process](#election-of-tc-members) described below. The TC members are expected to be active leaders in the project. A TC member may be removed from the TC by voluntary resignation, by a super-majority TC vote similar to the [election process](#election-of-tc-members), or in accordance with the participation rules described below.

Changes to TC membership should be posted in the agenda document, and may be suggested as any other agenda item.

### No Over-Representation
No more than one-fourth (25%) of the TC members may be affiliated with the same employer (in the event of confusion or concern, the OpenFeature TC will defer to the CNCF definition of "same employer"). If removal or resignation of a TC member, or a change of employment by a TC member, creates a situation where more than one-fourth of the TC membership shares an employer, then the situation must be immediately remedied by the resignation or removal of one or more TC members affiliated with the over-represented employer(s).

## Elections



### Election of TC Members

New TC members can be nominated by any Member in Standing as defined in the [OpenFeature Governance Charter](https://github.com/open-feature/community/blob/main/governance-charter.md), and must be sponsored by one of the existing TC members to bring it to a vote. A candidate can be elected to the TC by the super-majority vote (greater than two thirds) of the existing TC members. The voting by the TC members is anonymous. A multiple-candidate method, such as [Condorcet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_method) or [Single Transferable Vote](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_transferable_vote), may be used to conduct the vote, by phrasing the selections as:

* Vote for Nominee X
* Vote against Nominee X

The voting should remain open for a minimum of 5 business days.

### Election of TC Chair

The TC will elect from amongst voting TC members a TC Chairperson to work on building an agenda for TC meetings. The TC shall hold annual elections to select a TC Chairperson; there are no limits on the number of terms a TC Chairperson may serve.

For election of persons (such as the TC Chairperson) by a vote of the TC voting members, a multiple-candidate method should be used, such as:

* [Condorcet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_method) or
* [Single Transferable Vote](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_transferable_vote)

Multiple-candidate methods may be reduced to simple election by plurality when there are only two candidates for one position to be filled. No election is required if there is only one candidate and no objections to the candidates election. Elections shall be done within the Projects by the collaborators active in the Project.
